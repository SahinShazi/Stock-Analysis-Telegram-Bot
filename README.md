## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The bot follows a simple yet powerful workflow:

1. A user sends a stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL`) to the bot on Telegram.
2. The bot fetches real-time financial data from the **Twelve Data API**.
3. It generates a stock chart image by making a request to **Finviz**.
4. It prepares a detailed prompt, combining its instructions with the real-time data.
5. This prompt is sent to a powerful AI model via the **OpenRouter API**.
6. The AI analyzes the information and generates a structured report.
7. Finally, the bot formats the response and sends the chart and the AI-generated analysis back to the user.
